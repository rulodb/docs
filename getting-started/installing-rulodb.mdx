<Note>
  As RuloDB is in early stages of development, a limited set of architectures are supported. Builds
  are available for x86_64 (on Ubuntu/Debian & Windows) and arm64 (on macOS) architectures. _If you
  happen to be using a different architecture, you can [build RuloDB from
  source](/internals/building-from-source)._
</Note>

    chmod +x ./rulodb
