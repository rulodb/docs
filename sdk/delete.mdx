<Danger>
  **Data Loss Warning**: This operation permanently deletes all documents in the selection.
</Danger>

## Syntax

<CodeGroup>

```ts TypeScript
selection.delete() â†’ result
```

</CodeGroup>

### Arguments

No arguments.

### Optargs

No optional arguments.

### Returns

<ResponseField name="result" type="object">
  Information about the operation.

  <Expandable title="properties">
    <ResponseField name="deleted" type="number">
      The number of documents successfully deleted.
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

## Behavior

- Deletes documents from the selection (single document, filtered results, etc.).
- Can delete multiple documents when applied to a selection that matches multiple documents.
- If no documents match the selection, no error is thrown and `deleted` count will be 0.
- Deleted documents are permanently removed.

## Notes & Caveats

- Delete operations are irreversible - make sure you have backups if needed.

## Example

### Delete a single document by ID

Delete a specific user by their primary key.

<CodeGroup>

```ts TypeScript
const result = await r.table('users').get('user_123').delete().run(client);

if (result.deleted > 0) {
  console.log('User deleted successfully');
} else {
  console.log('User not found');
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Delete multiple documents with filter

Delete all inactive users from the system.

<CodeGroup>

```ts TypeScript
const result = await r
  .table('users')
  .filter((doc) => doc.field('status').eq('inactive'))
  .delete()
  .run(client);

console.log(`Deleted ${result.deleted} inactive users`);
```

</CodeGroup>
